I will be examining the implied meridional heat transport in the atmosphere using the NASA [MERRA-2](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/M2TMNXINT_5.12.4/summary?keywords=M2TMNXINT) reanalysis dataset. For each column of the atmosphere (represented by one pixel of the dataset), I will calculate the sensible and latent heat net fluxes into the column at the Earth's surface and the top of the atmosphere. Then, I will assume steady state (no heating or cooling of the column), which means that all of that net flux must flow horizontally out of the column. I'll take the annual mean and zonal mean, which will leave me with just the implied _meridional_ heat transport. The goal will be to make a figure with latitude on the x-axis and implied net northward heat transport on the y-axis; it should be 0 at both poles and close to the equator. This will be a first step towards a larger goal of calculating the _actual_ (i.e., not implied) heat transport from wind speed, humidity, etc., which may be beyond the scope of this class project. In that calculation, I want to compare the total meridional heat transport with that of the Hadley cell alone, which will give me insight into the role of eddies.
